piping - In Node.js, piping automatically reads data in chunks 
from a readable stream and writes it to a writable stream, handling 
backpressure automatically 

 readStream.pipe(writeStream)

 pipe() - inside ( ) it should be a writable stream
 you can also specify a duplex and transform

 You can pipe chaining like this

 readStream.pipe(writeStream).pipe(anotherWritable).pipe(dfsf)

 readStream.pipe(writeStream)
  ---> pipe can only executable on readstream.cannot execute on writable
