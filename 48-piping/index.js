// Once reading and writing are done, itâ€™s important to properly close the streams.
// If the code above executes successfully, Node.js will automatically close the streams.
// However, if an error occurs during reading or writing, the streams may remain open,
// leading to resource leaks.
// To handle errors and ensure both streams are closed safely, use 'stream.pipeline()' 
// or the 'pump' package instead of manually piping.



// the "end" event runs on the readStream, not the writeStream.

// Hereâ€™s what happens step by step:
// srcFile.createReadStream() creates a readable stream (readStream).
// destFile.createWriteStream() creates a writable stream (writeStream).
// When you do readStream.pipe(writeStream), Node.js automatically:
// Reads chunks from readStream
// Writes them to writeStream
// Handles backpressure internally

// When the readStream finishes reading all data from the file, it emits the "end" event.
// Thatâ€™s when your callback in readStream.on("end", ...) runs â€” signaling that reading is finished.

// ðŸ’¡ However:

// "end" only means the readable stream has no more data.
// It doesnâ€™t guarantee that writing to the destination file is completely finished yet.
// If you want to be 100% sure the copy operation is fully done, itâ€™s better to listen to the "finish" event on the writeStream:

// writeStream.on("finish", () => {
//   console.timeEnd("copy");
// });


// That ensures all data has been flushed and written to disk.
// So in short:
// "end" â†’ emitted by readStream (reading done)
// "finish" â†’ emitted by writeStream (writing done âœ…)
